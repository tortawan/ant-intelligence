# Project-specific ignores
# -------------------------------------------------------------------

# Build output directories (if you create a separate 'build' folder)
# build/ # Uncomment if you use a separate build directory for CMake/make

# Output data files (consider Git LFS for large essential files)
# If you want to track *some* CSVs (e.g., small examples),
# be more specific or use negative patterns like:
# *.csv
# !data/example_data.csv
# For now, ignoring all CSVs as per your current .gitignore
*.csv

# Video output
*.mp4

# Old code backups (should be handled by Git history)
save_code/

# If you decide NOT to commit solution/project files (generally recommended to commit them)
# *.sln
# *.vcxproj

# Ignore specific files from your folder_structure.txt that are build artifacts
# (Many of these are already covered by the general rules above)
ConsoleApp_ffmpeg/x64/ # Covered by x64/
ConsoleApp_ffmpeg.exe.recipe # Covered by *.recipe
ConsoleApp_ffmpeg.vcxproj.FileListAbsolute.txt # Covered by *.FileListAbsolute.txt (or just ignore .txt if too broad)

# If you have other specific build artifacts in ConsoleApp_ffmpeg/ that aren't caught
# ConsoleApp_ffmpeg/*.log # Covered by *.log
# ConsoleApp_ffmpeg/*.obj # Covered by *.obj
# ... and so on
